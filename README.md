# Activiti App Enterprise Dependencies

As of Activiti Enterprise 1.3.2 the activiti-app WAR project includes the transitive dependencies that are important
for creating JAR extensions in com.activiti:activiti-app-dependencies.  This project aims to create these dependencies
for older versions of Activiti enterprise.  Currently only 1.3.1 is created however additional version can also be
created and made available.

## Next Steps

As this is the initial release there are a number of things that still need to be done.  The biggest things are more
logistical such as:

+ Publish this dependency to Maven central.
+ Usage documentation needs to be written and made available.
+ Supplementary documentation like How-to blogs and videos.
